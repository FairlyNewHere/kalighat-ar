# Kalighat Painting in WebAR
This project was created during Hack4OpenGLAM as a part of CC Global Summit 2020.
The aim here was to bring alive an open image of a Kalighat painting from DAG Museums in India by creating a 3D model and augmenting it with WebAR.
For creating the 3D model, Blender was used which is a free and open source 3D creation suite.
After creating the model, the augmented reality experience for the web was developed using A-frame and Ar.js, both of which are open source libraries.

Bringing the said interaction to web eliminates the requirement of downloading an app, thereby making it easier for people to get onboard and enjoy the experience.
Plus, it works on both iOS and Android as well as old phones since it is totally web based.
So, a large audience can be tapped and reached using this technology.
You can try the experience by directly scanning the following QR code using any mobile and pointing the camera on the marker.
There you go! Enjoy moving the model around with your fingers (zoom in, zoom out and rotate) as you like!
